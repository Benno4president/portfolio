  <h2>Wiz lightbulb console app</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="static/item_imgs/wiz_light.gif" width="30%" align="right" />
  </p>
  <p>
    I developed a script designed to discover and manage all Wiz lights connected to my Wi-Fi network. This
    tool allows for seamless control of all of Wiz lights, even as their locations change and their IP
    addresses fluctuate. One of the standout features of this script is its ability to cache registered IPs and
    settings, which minimizes delays and enables near-instant control. This fast operation also lends itself well to
    automation scenarios, making it particularly useful for coordinating lighting during events like a "Tour de
    chambre." To ensure reliable performance, the script integrates the pywizlight library, which leverages the
    necessary communication protocols.

  <h2>Timescaledb ready-to-go stack w/ metric collection</h2>
  <p>
    Database deployment solution utilizing TimescaleDB, pgAdmin, Telegraf, and Grafana, aimed at managing timeseries
    data for various projects. This stack provides an efficient, scalable, and visually informative approach to
    monitoring and analyzing real-time metrics. It uses TimescaleDB; A PostgreSQL extension tailored for
    timeseries data, which supports complex queries and time-based analytic. pgAdmin; A web interface for managing
    postgres, facilitating easier database administration and query
    execution. Telegraf for a reliable metrics collector that gathers performance data in real-time for analysis, and
    Grafana; A dashboard tool that transforms metrics into interactive visualizations. A Timescaledb sql script was
    created for the news fetcher which leverages the advanced options available via Timescale. It can be found <a

    A barebones script built using python with Flask and qrencode to turn your
    computer into a local file drop. It spins up a web server, generates a QR
    code, and lets anyone on your network upload files straight to your machine.
    Just a quick and dirty way to share files. Thrown together for casual use at
    my living collective, where it comes in handy for file backups and party
    events.

  <h2>School task list generator</h2>
  <p><img src="static/item_imgs/mors-skema.png" width="40%" align="left" /></p>
  <p>
    A HTML/CSS/JS Github Pages app to create kitchen duty week lists, built for
    Højskolen Mors where I went E24. It evenly spreads assignments across the
    week and tries not to stick the same person on the same day again and again.
    The clean, print-friendly layout makes it easy to download and slap onto the
    fridge or bulletin board. You can find it
    <a href="https://benno4president.github.io/mors-skema/">here</a>. It is
    designed to keep things running smoothly, save countless hours and a lot of
    grumbling for the interns who come after us.

  <h2>Master's Thesis: Drones for security and surveillance</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="static/item_imgs/masters.png" width="40%" align="right" />
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote my thesis at Aalborg University in Human-Computer Interaction,
    supervised by Timothy Robert Merritt. Our project was part of HERD, which
    looks at how drones and drone swarms can improve areas like agriculture,
    public safety, and search and rescue. In the first semester, we worked with
    Robotto, an AI and drone company, and Amagerværket, a biofuel power plant.
    Together, we ran co-design sessions to figure out the best ways to show
    biofuel data to users and explore how drones could help manage critical
    infrastructure. Later, we focused on how drones can improve the security and
    safety of critical infrastructure, especially as threats become more
    advanced and traditional monitoring isn't enough. We researched what
    operations staff need from drone systems and how interfaces should be
    designed to support them. The project resulted in practical design
    suggestions that can help both designers and researchers build better
    drone-based security solutions.

  <h2>Generating network visualizations from user documentation</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="static/item_imgs/doc_mapper3.png" width="46%" align="right" />
  </p>
  <p>
    Documentation scraper and network visualization tool developed for Playday
    in Python. The application combines a webscraper and a GEXF network
    generator to optimize user-facing documentation. The scraper uses
    requests and BeautifulSoup with a breadth-first search to crawl all valid
    links. The harvested data is processed into pandas DataFrames and converted
    into .gexf files via NetworkX, enabling visualization in Gephi. Clustering
    algorithms in Gephi assign colors to nodes, effectively isolating navigation
    clusters and revealing user traversal paths through the documentation. This
    approach provides clear, actionable insights for improving content structure.

  <h2>Bulk news article scraper w/ sentiment scoring</h2>

  <p>
    This is a Python toolkit I built for collecting and analyzing news articles.
    It uses Selenium, BeautifulSoup, and Pandas to scrape content and stores the
    results in a SQL database with SQLModel. The modular design makes it easy to
    add new sources by implementing a scraper class based on the IScraper
    interface. Another script, db2coin_sentiment.py, applies sentiment analysis
    using VADER, m2 from NLTK, and FBERT from HuggingFace to generate insights
    from the collected data.

  <h2>Satellite image splitter w/ detection and world file support</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="static/item_imgs/area-analyser.jpg" width="45%" align="right" />
  </p>
  <p>
    This Python script processes .png images by splitting them into smaller
    tiles of a specified size. For example, a 10.000×10.000 px satellite image
    with a target tile size of 250×250 px produces 1.600 smaller images. Beyond
    splitting, the script analyzes each tile to calculate the percentage of
    specific colors (by default, detecting forest and water bodies). If
    accompanying .pgw files are present (with the same base filename as the
    .png), the script reads them as top-left corner coordinates. It then
    calculates the geolocation of each tile and stores this alongside the color
    data. The goal is to process and enrich data for use in machine learning
    workflows.
