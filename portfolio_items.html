  <h2>Generating network visualizations from user documentation</h2>

  <p>
    Documentation scraper and network visualization tool developed for Playday
    in Python. The application combines a webscraper scraper and a GEXF network
    generator to optimize Playday's user-facing documentation. The scraper uses
    requests and BeautifulSoup with a breadth-first search to crawl all valid
    links. The harvested data is processed into pandas DataFrames and converted
    into .gexf files via NetworkX, enabling visualization in Gephi. Clustering
    algorithms in Gephi assign colors to nodes, effectively isolating navigation
    clusters and revealing user traversal paths through the documentation. This
    approach provides clear, actionable insights for improving content structure
    and discoverability.

    A barebones script built using python with Flask and qrencode to turn your
    computer into a local file drop. It spins up a web server, generates a QR
    code, and lets anyone on your network upload files straight to your machine.
    Just a quick and dirty way to share files. Thrown together for casual use at
    my living collective, where it comes in handy for file backups and party
    events.

  <h2>School task list generator</h2>
  <p><img src="static/item_imgs/mors-skema.png" width="40%" align="left" /></p>
  <p>
    A HTML/CSS/JS Github Pages app to create kitchen duty week lists, built for
    Højskolen Mors where I went E24. It evenly spreads assignments across the
    week and tries not to stick the same person on the same day again and again.
    The clean, print-friendly layout makes it easy to download and slap onto the
    fridge or bulletin board. You can find it
    <a href="https://benno4president.github.io/mors-skema/">here</a>. It is
    designed to keep things running smoothly, save countless hours and a lot of
    grumbling for the interns who come after us.

  <h2>Master's Thesis: Drones for security and surveillance</h2>
  <p>
    <img src="static/item_imgs/masters.png" width="40%" align="right" />
  </p>
  <p>
    I wrote my thesis at Aalborg University in Human-Computer Interaction,
    supervised by Timothy Robert Merritt. Our project was part of HERD, which
    looks at how drones and drone swarms can improve areas like agriculture,
    public safety, and search and rescue. In the first semester, we worked with
    Robotto, an AI and drone company, and Amagerværket, a biofuel power plant.
    Together, we ran co-design sessions to figure out the best ways to show
    biofuel data to users and explore how drones could help manage critical
    infrastructure. Later, we focused on how drones can improve the security and
    safety of critical infrastructure, especially as threats become more
    advanced and traditional monitoring isn't enough. We researched what
    operations staff need from drone systems and how interfaces should be
    designed to support them. The project resulted in practical design
    suggestions that can help both designers and researchers build better
    drone-based security solutions.
