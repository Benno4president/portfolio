    A barebones script built using python with Flask and qrencode to turn your computer into a local file drop. It spins
    up a web server, generates a QR code, and lets anyone on your network upload files straight to your machine. Just a
    quick
    and dirty way to share files. Thrown together for casual use at my living collective,
    where it comes in handy for file backups and party events.

  <p>
    A HTML/CSS/JS Github Pages app to create kitchen duty week lists, built for Højskolen Mors where I went E24. It evenly spreads assignments across the week and
    tries
    not to stick the same person on the same day again and again. The clean, print-friendly layout makes it easy to
    download and slap onto the fridge or bulletin board. You can find it <a
      href="https://benno4president.github.io/mors-skema/">here</a>. It is designed to keep things running
    smoothly, save countless hours and a lot of grumbling for the interns who
    come after us.
